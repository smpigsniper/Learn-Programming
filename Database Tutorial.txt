This Tutorial is talking about SQL Database.
You can use MySQL, Ms SQL, Oracle SQL
They both statement is same but some inside function or the function Syntax is different.
That base on each Database version each version the statement is different.
If you want deep learn to database please tell me.

One server can be more Database
foreach database can be more table

-- create table statement

CREATE TABLE table_name {
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    column3 datatype
}

Example:

CREATE TABLE USER {
    username varchar(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    password varchar(255) NOT NULL
};

What is the PRIMARY KEY?
primary key is a constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table
Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot contain NULL values.
A table can have only ONE primary key; and in the table, this primary key can consist of single or multiple columns (fields).

Now you created a user table in your database
