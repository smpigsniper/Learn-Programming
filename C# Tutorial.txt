C# comments is '//'

variables
In C# there are different types of variables (defined with defferent keywords), for example:
int - stores integer (whole numbers) without decimals, such as 123, or -123
double - store floating point numbers, with decimals such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - store single character such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - store text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - sotres values with two states: true or false
By the way, "Hello World" is first time run the program show it.


Declaring (Create) variables

Syntax:
type variableName = value;

example:
string name = "Pang";
int numbers = 30;
double doubleNumber = 5.99;
bool boolType = true;

一般decalring variable name 有幾種
1. string create_user_name = "";
2. string createUserName = "";
有大細寫 or 用 _ 來分開D字 一般decalring個variable name 都有意思 方便自己同人哋睇

Coding
using System;

namespace HelloWorld
{
  class Program
  {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      string username = ""; 
      Console.WriteLine("My name is " + " " + username); // when run the program username output is My name is ;
      username = "Pang";
      Console.WriteLine("My name is " + " " + username); // when run the program username output is My name is Pang;
    }
  }
}
